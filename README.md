## Introduction

Data visualization is an essential part of data analysis, helping to reveal patterns, trends, and outliers. In this project, we focus on creating bar charts and histograms to visualize population data. These visualizations can be used to explore the distribution of different variables such as age, gender, or total population over time.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is obtained from the World Bank and focuses on global population data. It can be accessed via the following link: [World Bank Population Data](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL).

- **Dataset Features:**
  - `Country Name`: The name of the country.
  - `Country Code`: The ISO code for the country.
  - `Year`: The year of the data point.
  - `Population`: The total population for the given country and year.

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, ensure you have Python installed on your system along with the following packages:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ayatmahmoud/PRODIGY_DS_01/
   cd population-visualization
   ```

2. **Download the dataset:**

   Download the dataset from [World Bank Population Data](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL) and place it in the `data/` directory.

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**

   Open the `task1.ipynb` or `task1-2.ipynb` file and run the cells to preprocess the data, and create visualizations of the population distribution.

4. **Analyze the Results:**

   The notebook provides visualizations of population distributions through bar charts and histograms, allowing for an in-depth analysis of the population data.

## Results

The visualizations generated include:

- **Bar Charts**: Showing the distribution of population data across different countries or years.
- **Histograms**: Displaying the frequency distribution of population sizes or other continuous variables.

These visualizations help in understanding global population trends, comparing population sizes across countries, and identifying changes in population over time.
